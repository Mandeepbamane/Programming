<h3>Daily Routine</h3>
<blockquote>
 My daily routine typically starts with waking up at 7:00 AM,following a morning hygiene routine and having a nutritious breakfast. 
Attend classes, take notes, and use breaks to study or review materials. 
Afternoon involves a balanced lunch, more study or assignment work, and physical 
exercise for well-being. Late afternoon is dedicated to extracurricular activities 
and socializing with friends. Evenings are for dinner and another study session, 
followed by personal time for relaxation and hobbies. 
The day ends with reviewing the next day's schedule and aiming for 
7-8 hours of sleep. Weekends offer more flexibility for social activities, 
relaxation, and personal growth.
